## Abstract
Face recognition is one of the biometrics applications. The face recognition system is a computer
application that can recognize or check a person from the digital image or video stream from a video
source by comparing the selected facial features.he face recognition model needs specific methods to
extract unique features from the face images to deal with the high complexity. Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms are commonly used to
reduce featuresâ€™ dimensionality space. This research aims to build SVM model and train it for face
recognition task. The data will be shifted to a new space that is lower in dimensionality than the
original space used. Two dimensionality reduction methods, PCA and NMF, are utilized. The subgoal
is to compare the two methods and evaluate them.

## Dataset
The Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) Database of Faces was collected by ATT Laboratories. This set of face
images was taken between April 1992 and April 1994 at the lab.
